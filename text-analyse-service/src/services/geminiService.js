ULTRA-STRICT SCORING GUIDELINES - BE RUTHLESS:
- Responses under 15 words: Automatic 0-3 points maximum across ALL criteria
- Responses under 30 words: Maximum 5-12 points total  
- Responses under 50 words: Maximum 15-25 points total
- Generic answers without concrete examples: Maximum 20 points
- Answers missing crucial technical depth: Maximum 25 points
- Superficial responses that don't demonstrate expertise: Maximum 35 points
- Adequate but unremarkable answers: Maximum 45-55 points
- Only responses showing deep expertise and innovation should exceed 60 points
- Scores above 75 are reserved for responses that would impress principal engineers
- Scores above 85 should be extremely rare - only for truly exceptional insights

ENHANCED EVALUATION CRITERIA - MAXIMUM STRICTNESS:

1. Relevance (0-100):
   - 0-5: Completely off-topic, nonsensical, or shows no understanding
   - 6-15: Vaguely related but fundamentally misses the point
   - 16-25: Basic understanding but significant gaps in relevance
   - 26-35: Partially addresses question but lacks focus
   - 36-50: Adequately relevant but missing key aspects
   - 51-65: Well-targeted to the question with good focus
   - 66-80: Excellent relevance with comprehensive understanding
   - 81-95: Outstanding relevance with exceptional insights
   - 96-100: Perfect relevance with groundbreaking perspective

2. Structure & Clarity (0-100):
   - 0-5: Completely incoherent, unreadable, or too brief to evaluate
   - 6-15: Major structural problems, very difficult to follow
   - 16-25: Poor organization with confusing flow
   - 26-35: Basic structure but significant clarity issues
   - 36-50: Adequate organization but could be clearer
   - 51-65: Well-structured with good logical flow
   - 66-80: Excellent structure that enhances understanding
   - 81-95: Masterful organization with perfect clarity
   - 96-100: Exceptional structure that elevates the content

3. Completeness (0-100):
   - 0-5: Extremely incomplete, touches on virtually nothing
   - 6-15: Mentions only trivial aspects, misses everything important
   - 16-25: Covers some basics but misses most critical elements
   - 26-35: Addresses main points superficially
   - 36-50: Covers important aspects but lacks necessary depth
   - 51-65: Good coverage with adequate depth
   - 66-80: Comprehensive with excellent depth and breadth
   - 81-95: Exhaustive coverage including advanced concepts
   - 96-100: Perfect completeness with innovative additions

4. Technical Correctness (0-100):
   - 0-5: Fundamentally wrong, shows no technical competence
   - 6-15: Major technical errors throughout
   - 16-25: Multiple significant technical mistakes
   - 26-35: Some technical understanding but notable errors
   - 36-50: Generally correct but with concerning inaccuracies
   - 51-65: Mostly accurate with minor technical issues
   - 66-80: Technically sound with precise details
   - 81-95: Exceptional technical accuracy and sophistication
   - 96-100: Perfect technical mastery with cutting-edge insights

HARSH PENALTY RULES - APPLY AGGRESSIVELY:
- Deduct 30 points for any response showing lack of hands-on experience
- Deduct 25 points for each major technical misconception
- Deduct 20 points for overly simplistic answers to complex questions
- Deduct 35 points if response appears generic/memorized without deep understanding
- Deduct 15 points for any factual errors or outdated information
- Deduct 20 points if response lacks concrete examples or specifics
- Deduct 25 points if answer doesn't demonstrate problem-solving ability

ULTRA-STRICT SCORING THRESHOLDS:
- 0-10: Completely unacceptable, no technical competence shown
- 11-20: Severely inadequate, fundamental knowledge missing
- 21-30: Poor, major gaps in understanding
- 31-40: Below average, concerning lack of depth
- 41-50: Barely adequate, meets minimum expectations
- 51-60: Average, acceptable but unremarkable
- 61-70: Above average, shows good understanding
- 71-80: Good, demonstrates solid competence
- 81-90: Excellent, exceptional technical depth
- 91-100: Outstanding, expert-level mastery (extremely rare)

ADDITIONAL STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Responses must demonstrate DEEP technical understanding, not surface-level knowledge
- Candidates must show PRACTICAL experience, not just theoretical knowledge
- Answers should include SPECIFIC examples, technologies, or methodologies
- Technical accuracy must be PERFECT - any errors significantly impact scoring
- Responses must show ADVANCED problem-solving and critical thinking
- Only INNOVATIVE or INSIGHTFUL answers deserve high scores
